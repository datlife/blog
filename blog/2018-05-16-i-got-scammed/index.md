A few things I learned when purchasing a new used car. The "owner", or the-one-keep-the-pink-slip, rolled back the odometer which I should have checked the CarFax. They have done a good job with detailing the car but I still see a lot of missing nuts and bolts in the front engine. Unfortunately, my mind told me to just skip it and buy it. 

* Trust your gut, especially when you think those things are necessary, aka. absolutely needed, to do. 
* DO NOT RUSH because of the result, you might neglect the most important details.
* LEAVE YOUR EMOTIONS at home. This might be just me,
