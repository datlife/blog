> During childhood, books were my mentors, my friends, and my parallel reality. 
It played a significant role in my satisfaction for exploring the world. 
After college graduation, I finally have more free time to revisit my childhood hobby ðŸ™ƒ.

This year, 2020, I decided to make a wishlist of books I would like to read. 
I may adjust this list depending my free time and priorities. âœ… = Done, ðŸ“– = Reading.

### Note to myself:

>1. What changed in how one accessed to info since 2000?

Formally, reading book or taking a class is a means to access information.
In recent years, an interesting phenomenon about how one accessed to information 
is *very* different than 20 years ago. We have now blog posts, youtubers, and 
many other channels to access information.

* College students can take courses online by famous professors. 
* Software developers can use StackOverflow to obtain quick hints on a solution.
* Facebook allows users to obtain news faster than ever.

That is great! However, it is important for info consumers to be *selective*, 
and *skeptical* about what information to trust.
