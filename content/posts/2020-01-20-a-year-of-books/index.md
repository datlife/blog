> During childhood, books were my mentors, my friends, and my parallel reality. It played a significant role in my satisfaction for exploring the world. After college graduation, I finally have now more free time to revisit my childhood hobby.

This year, 2020, I decided to make a wishlist of books I would like to read in 2020. I may adjust this list depending my free time and priorities.

### Note to myself:
Formally, reading book or taking a class is a means to access information.
In recent years, an interesting phenomenon about how one accessed to information is *very* different than 20 years ago. 

We have now blog posts, youtubers, and many other channels to access information. That is great! However, it is important for info consumers to be *selective* and *thoughtful* about what information to trust.
